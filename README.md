# PonySDK
PonySDK is an open source project and application that uses open source tools built on the Java platform to help you develop Web applications quickly and efficiently

It encapsulates a Web server (for now, Jetty) on the backend side, and use GWT on the frontend side.
So, with PonySDK, you will be able to write standard Java code for creating your Web application.

## Version 2 Features

## Demo

For testing PonySDK, there is a sample that launched an embedded Jetty Server and served a demo page.

Follow the steps :

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Nciaravola/PonySDK.git
$ cd PonySDK
$ gradlew runSampleSpring
```

Wait a little and you will have on the console, logs like this :

```
INFO  [ContextHandler] Started o.e.j.s.ServletContextHandler@6440112d{/sample,null,AVAILABLE}
INFO  [AbstractConnector] Started ServerConnector@4239156f{HTTP/1.1,[http/1.1]}{0.0.0.0:8081}
INFO  [AbstractConnector] Started ServerConnector@5a7fe64f{SSL,[ssl, http/1.1]}{0.0.0.0:8082}
```
